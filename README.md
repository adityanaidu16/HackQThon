# HackQThon
HackQThon entry that utilizes Quantum Computing and Machine Learning for future stock insight.

## Problem Statement:

Imagine a world where nearly every investment you make in the stock market has adequate return.. All you would need to do is look at a chart in order to know if your stock will have an overall increase or decrease. One major reason this is not possible is because of how unpredictable the stock market appears to us. This unpredictability has proved to be fatal because throughout the course of a year at least 80% of investors in the stock market have lost money. Standard projection and analysis of chaotic systems can provide a challenge for even the greatest and fastest supercomputers in the modern world. Our project, Stock Overflow, reflects upon an attempt to improve it further. By incorporating aspects of quantum mechanics and qubits into our code, we are able to increase the code's validity and efficiency. With many of the recent events happening around the world, stock markets and investment opportunities have become sparse and unpredictable, which imposes a challenge for the supercomputers. For instance, recent trends have shown tremendous rises and dips which have not been projected by the best programs. Because  of the great amounts of variables and data to use as training data, current projections programs have been relatively slow to update and utilize. Often, the vast amount of information is too much for computers to handle and greatly decreases processing speeds. Because of the linear dynamics of regular computers, computation could be greatly slowed down from the fact that trends cannot be easily modeled by straight lines.

## Solution Statement:

Because of the vast amount of data to be processed by modern computers, the states of quantum computers have been introduced to aid with the process. By utilizing quantum mechanics in computation, algorithms and procedures can be executed thousands of times more quickly than they would be for regular supercomputers. Our project combines the famililarities of modern computations with the added benefits of quantum mechanics to provide a higher quality of outputs and results. In standard computers, trends are projected by linear regressions, but unlike a simple line we’ve drawn out in math class, a stock trend can be much more complicated and better modeled with an exponential or logarithmic regression of a quantum computer. Modern computation models are slowly leveling out as processing speed slows down on computer chips, instead of continually trying to work upon a soon unimprovable model, many computer scientists are currently investing their time into Quantum Computing. In Quantum Computing, qubits, the equivalent of a bit in quantum computing, are linked together through entanglement and by knowing the state of one qubit, you automatically gain insight into the other, making computations much easier. In standard computers, information is stored in items called bits, which can either be a 0 or 1, which is read inside an interpreter. Unlike standard computers, quantum computers run on items called quantum bits, qubits for short. Unlike the normal bit, which needs to be continually read one after another, qubits could be read all at the same time, without needing to wait for one task to finish. As an analogy, you can think of a series of bits stored behind locked doors, with one that’s open. A standard interpreter would need to open every single door one after another, which could take potentially millions of years to finish. But with a quantum computer, you could check them all at once, making it much more efficient, which is the reason why we’ve focused on that topic in this project.

## Inspiration
As the recent pandemic and problems engulfed our society in the past year, stock prices and the market have been filled with chaos and unpredictability. The members of our teams are actively attempting to invest in company stocks, but the recent blows have kept us down. Throughout the course of a year at least 80% of investors in the stock market have lost money. With this in mind, we decided to dedicate this project to that idea and try to improve upon it. Traditional computers only take us so far as to computational speeds, so recently computer scientists have invested time and energy into Quantum Computing, a much more elegant solution to our problems.

## What it does
As an aid towards the prompt of modern problems, our program, StockOverflow, is a stock projecting algorithm that incorporates quantum computing into classical mechanics. Our project combines the famililarities of modern computations with the added benefits of quantum mechanics to provide a higher quality of outputs and results. In standard computers, trends are projected by linear regressions, but unlike a simple line we’ve drawn out in math class, a stock trend can be much more complicated and better modeled with an exponential or logarithmic regression of a quantum computer, as we have done in this project.

## Challenges we ran into

As most of us are rather rudimentary to computer science and quantum mechanics, this project was difficult for us to pull off. To create the code capable of projecting the stock trends, we spent numerous hours scratching our heads to come up with a successful idea, and eventually succeeded. Also to that point, one of our teammates recently got contaminated with Covid-19 right before the competition started and was forced to stay at home to work instead of meeting together and helping to accomplish the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our abilities to learn multiple modules in 2 days and to be able to write a program are not only beneficial to us but also to others.
