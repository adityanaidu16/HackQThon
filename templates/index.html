                                                      The problem, though, is that modern computational speeds are have nearly peaked, and is projected to eventually plateau, stopping 
                                                      the bettering of computation speeds. Classical machine learning, though amazing, has proved to have many flaws and problems. 
                                                      One has to first provide vast amounts of training datas, which leads to long periods of wait time and high cost, then having 
                                                      to be modeled with linear regression lines, and eventually provide not very accurate results.
